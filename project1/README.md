This project only has one source file named coms352_project_1.c. Within this
file is all the code needed for a shell with basic command use, background
process functionality, redirecting output and kill command. The basic 
structure for containing commands that are in the background is a linked list
called struct process. 

side note (finished processes do not show as finished until we enter something
into command input, reading from project specifications i felt this was alright)
This is the second time i turned it in because i had to fix the order 
background processes finish.
