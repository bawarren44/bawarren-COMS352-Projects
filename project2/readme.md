The encrypt352.c file is my man method and running "make" on the terminal
will create the encrypt352 executable file. To run this file you must input
./encrypt352 <input file> > <output file>. When running the executable will
encrypt the input file into the ouput file. Also, the count of each character
will be tracked via variables in encrypt.c. Sometimes the execution seems to
take long but i assume its because the reset timers. The execution has yet to
crash. This project was done by Brad Warren bawarren@iastate.edu.
